# [Testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_testing) [Angular](https://angularjs.org/)
Here you can find a list of resources that I came through testing my angular 1.x applications.

I'll try to keep them organized as best as I can.
Hope you'll find them helpful like me.

### Why

Finding helpful material is never easy when you are working with a framework that let you get the same results in many different ways.
By the time I saved almost all resources that helped me solve my questions.

### Getting Started
Let's start from the bottom, because nothing can be clear if you don't know what you're working on.
* [Official doc for unit testing](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/unit-testing)
* [Official doc for e2e testing](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/e2e-testing)

### Tools
Tool         | Description
------------ | -------------
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) | Test runner
[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) / [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) / [UnitJS](http://unitjs.com/)| Unit test frameworks
[Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/) | e2e test frameworks

I tried every test framework listed above and I definitely agree with [the JS guy](http://thejsguy.com/2015/01/12/jasmine-vs-mocha-chai-and-sinon.html)
