# [Testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_testing) [Angular](https://angularjs.org/)
Here you can find a list of resources that I came through testing several angular 1.x applications.

I'll try to keep them organized as best as I can.
Hope you'll find them helpful like me.

* **[Unit test resources](./unit-test.md)**
* **[E2E test resources](./e2e-test.md)**

### Why
Find helpful material is never easy when you are working with a framework that let you get the same results in many different ways.
By the time I saved almost all resources that helped me solve my questions.

### Getting Started
Before reading other listed resources I recommend to take a look at the official Angular docs.
They provide test cases in the developer guide.
* [Official doc for unit testing](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/unit-testing)
* [Official doc for e2e testing](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/e2e-testing)

## Contributing
**PRs Welcome!** I would love see this list integrated with any other resources that can help the community. Don't be afraid to say what you think or propose new material to be added.
