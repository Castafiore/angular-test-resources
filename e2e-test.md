> **What does End-to-End Test mean?**


>End-to-end testing is a methodology used to test whether the flow of an application is performing as designed from start to finish. The purpose of carrying out end-to-end tests is to identify system dependencies and to ensure that the right information is passed between various system components and systems.


>End-to-end testing involves ensuring that that integrated components of an application function as expected. The entire application is tested in a real-world scenario such as communicating with the database, network, hardware and other applications 

 
### The AngularJS way

Angular's team have built [Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/), an end to end test runner which simulates user interactions that will help you verify the health of your Angular application.
Protractor is built on top of [WebDriverJS](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs).
